1. REGEXP_REPLACE()
Purpose: Removes (or replaces) parts of a string using a regular expression.
Syntax:
REGEXP_REPLACE(string, pattern, replacement)
Example:
REGEXP_REPLACE('Hello, world!', '[[:punct:]]', '')
-- Result: 'Hello world'
  
2. REPLACE()
Purpose: Replaces all instances of a substring with another.
Syntax:
REPLACE(original_string, search_string, replace_string)
Example:
REPLACE('a b c', ' ', '-')
-- Result: 'a-b-c'
  
3. CONCAT()
Purpose: Combines multiple strings into one.
Syntax:
CONCAT(string1, string2, ..., stringN)
Example:
CONCAT('a', 'b', 'c')
-- Result: 'abc'
  
4. JSON_TABLE()
Purpose: Turns a JSON array into a virtual table (rows from array items).
Syntax:
JSON_TABLE(
  json_string,
  '$[*]'
  COLUMNS (
    column_name datatype PATH '$'
  )
)
Example:
JSON_TABLE('["cat","dog"]', '$[*]'
  COLUMNS (word VARCHAR(100) PATH '$')
)

5. PERCENTILE_CONT(p) – “What value lies at the top X%?”
Think: “What’s the test score that separates the top 5% of students?”
You give it a percentile (like 0.95 for 95%), and it tells you the exact score at that point.

SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fraud_score) FROM fraud_data;
This means: “Give me the fraud score where 95% of scores are below it.”

6. NTILE(n) – “Split people into groups”
Think: “Put all employees into 4 performance groups (quartiles)”
It divides your sorted data into n groups, and tells you which group each row is in.

SELECT NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY fraud_score DESC) FROM fraud_data;
That assigns a tile number (1 to 4) to each record.
If you use NTILE(100), you get percentiles (1 to 100).

7. PERCENT_RANK() – “How high did I rank compared to others?”
Think: “What’s my score’s percentile rank?”
It gives a decimal from 0 to 1 based on position in the group.

SELECT PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY fraud_score) FROM fraud_data;
Example:
If you're the highest, you get 1.0
If you're average, maybe 0.5
If you're lowest, 0.0

Visual Summary (Fraud Score: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
fraud_score	NTILE(5)	PERCENT_RANK()
10	1	0.00
20	2	0.25
30	3	0.50
40	4	0.75
50	5	1.00

8. CONCAT()
Purpose: Joins strings together.

Syntax:
CONCAT(string1, string2, ..., stringN)

Example:
CONCAT('John', ' ', 'Doe')

9. CAST() WHEN DOING DIVISION

When doing division have the numerator cast as float or else it won't give any answer.
Ex: 3/5 = 0
but cast(3 as float)/5 = 0.6

10. LENGTH() function returns the number of bytes in a string, not the number of characters (important if you're dealing with multi-byte character sets like UTF-8).
Syntax: LENGTH(string)
Example: SELECT LENGTH('hello'); -- returns 5
🧠 Tip:
If you want the number of characters, use CHAR_LENGTH() instead:
SELECT CHAR_LENGTH('你好'); -- returns 2
SELECT LENGTH('你好');      -- returns 6 (each character is 3 bytes in 

11. Cross Join
The CROSS JOIN operation in SQL combines every row from the first table with every row from the second table. This results in a Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning every row from the first table is paired with every row from the second table.
